      \begin{cvitems}
        \item {Worked on APITrace, an open source project, which is used to capture the frames which are being
               displayed and make a trace file out of it. The trace file created contains several frames, these frames are
               filled with EGL calls. This trace file data streamed over network and can be replayed on phone using
                Retracer app}
        \item {The basic idea behind the project is to remotely display the contents of the Smartphone on to another
basic display, thus the Smartphone can be ripped of its display and use any display to view and Interact
with the phone}
        \item {Started with System level Tracing and worked on the Source code to make it run on specific Android API
level(API 19),version 4.4.2 and Ported it to work on Android version 5.0}
